## About Me

I am a first year Master's student at Georgia Tech. I work under [Professor Wei Xu](https://cocoxu.github.io/), finding solutions to make multilingual LLMs more relevant to languages other than English. More casually, I am interested in LLMs as time series predictors.

Professionally, I am a Research Science Intern at Lockheed Martin. I work on low SWaP intelligent applications.

Personally, I enjoy many hobbies, such as reading, amateur radio, video games, and more. I am on the executive board of Georgia Tech's Russian Speaking Association.

Desk: CODA S1183G
